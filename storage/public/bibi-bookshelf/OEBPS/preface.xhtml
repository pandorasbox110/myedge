		<strong>Ladders to Learning Series-Mathematics Kinder 2</strong>
(Second Edition) is designed to help pupils gain mastery
of basic mathematical concepts and skills and develop
confidence in doing mathematical operations. It also aims
to train pupils to begin solving computational problems at
an earlier age.
	</p>
	<p class="txt">
		The worktext primarily develops number sense and
measuring skills. In unit 1, the pupils will learn about the
symbols for the numbers 1 to 100 and their order based
on their values, and compare their values in different
ways. In unit 2, they will get a grasp of number words
one to hundreds as well as other types of numbers such
as ordinal numbers and roman numerals. They will also
learn to classify numbers as odd or even, and skip count.
In unit 3, the pupils will learn how to add numbers using
different methods, as well as solve real-life problems using
addition. In unit 4, the pupils will subtract numbers using
different methods, and apply subtraction in word problems.
In unit 5, the pupils will learn about fractions, and how they
are associated with parts of a whole or a set. In unit 6, the
pupils will identify days and months. In unit 7, the pupils will
learn about hours and half hours. In unit 8, the pupils will
know about money values and their use in real life. Finally,
in unit 9, they will learn about measurement, specifically,
how to measure length and height. This unit also presents
different shapes.

		Each lesson has the following components:
	</p>
	
	<p class='txt2'>
		<strong>Let Us Learn</strong>—introduces the main topic of the lesson
through a variety of examples and explanations.
Some lessons include preliminary exercises to help
the pupils learn the figure, property, or operation
being discussed.
	</p>
	
	<p class='txt2'>
		<strong>Let Us Try</strong>—provides exercises that test the pupils’
understanding of concepts and allow them to apply
the lesson they learned.
	</p>
	
	
	<p class='txt2'>
		<strong>Let Us Practice</strong>—ensures the pupils’ mastery of the lesson
using more hands-on exercises.
	</p>
	
	
	<p class='txt'>
		It is hoped that as the pupils climb up the ladders to
learning mathematics, they will have the competence
in applying their knowledge of numbers and figures in
the real world. Thus, pupils will be prepared to excel in a
mathematically oriented environment of the twenty-first
century.
